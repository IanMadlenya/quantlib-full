for 0.3.9:

Autogeneration
- document how it works
- only update files if they change (need to exclude timestamp from diff)

Doxygen
- now that the interface layer has been replaced by the factory function,
there are no header files to feed to Doxygen - autogenerate a dummy header
from function metadata?

Calc
- allow null inputs where appropriate
- parameter help info in function wizard
- document all the steps and dependencies required to compile

QuantLibAddin core
- improve existing options functionality
- autoconf for Excel?

for a later release:
